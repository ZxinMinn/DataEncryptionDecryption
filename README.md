# Data Encryption and Decription with C#

# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm
    Symmetric Encryption: This method uses the same key for encryption and decryption

# RSA Algorithm
    Public Key Encryption    
    Also known as asymmetric cryptography.    
    Two keys are used: Public Key and Private Key.    
    Public Key: For encryption.
