# Data Encryption and Decription with C#

# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm
    Symmetric Encryption: This method uses the same key for encryption and decryption

# RSA Algorithm
    Public Key Encryption    
    Also known as asymmetric cryptography.    
    Two keys are used: Public Key and Private Key.    
    Public Key: For encryption.    
    Private Key: For decryption, also known as a secret key.

# SHA_256 
    SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input (message) and produces a fixed-size, 
    256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It is a part of the SHA-2 family of hash functions, which includes 
    SHA-224, SHA-384, and SHA-512.
     
    8 bit =  1 bytes 
    256 bit devided by 8 bit equals 32 byte
